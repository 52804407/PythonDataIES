# Data Processing in Python (JEM207)

The course site for the Data Processing in Python from [IES](http://ies.fsv.cuni.cz/). See information on [SIS](https://is.cuni.cz/studium/predmety/index.php?do=predmet&kod=JEM207). The course is taught by [Martin Hronec](mailto:martin.hronec@fsv.cuni.cz), [Jan Šíla](mailto:jan.sila@fsv.cuni.cz) and 
[Alena Pavlovova](mailto:alena.pavlovova@fsv.cuni.cz).

## Communication
Please direct all questions at [Alena Pavlova](mailto:alena.pavlova@fsv.cuni.cz) only. 

## FAQ - pre semester

* If you are on **waiting list** there is *nothing* we can do to enroll you. We managed to master somehow `python`, but SIS is something else. We follow the rules. Students usully drop from the course during the first week of the semester so **there is a good chance** you will be able to register.

* The course is held **in-person** and there is by default **no online** option.

* If you are junior to last BSc year/ MSc level, please consider your coding skills. If you just started coding (R or anything else), please consider signing up later on. We will still be here (hopefully) next semester as well.
* If you decide to *drop out after the 2-week grace period*, note that if you submit homework, you will be awarded "F" mark followin the university guidelines. Please, do consider this as well with regards to staying in the course. There might be others waiting for the spot.

# Course requirements
The requirements for passing the course are homeworks (5pts), the midterm (25pts), work in-progress-presentation (10pts), and the final project - including the final delivery presentation (60pts).
At least 50% from the homeworks assignments and work-in-progress presentation is required for passing the course.

* Deadline for topic approval: 5th of December 2023
* Deadline: 9th of February 2024

### Projects' Evaluation critera
* Use of git by both - 5pts
    * meaningful commit messages
* pythonic code principles - 5 pts
    * code is more often read than written, EAFP
* runability - 15 pts
    * by far the most important one! Project needs to run from scratch after installing versioned requirements.
* code structure - 15 pts
    * functions (classes), properly named variables
* README, documentation - 5 pts
* analysis, visualization - 15 pts
    * highlight key poins of your projet

## Project work - presentation (10%)
* Presentation of work-in-progress related to the final project.
* Prepare questions, understand the goals of your project

## Midterm exam (25%)
Live coding (80 minutes), "open browser", no collaboration between the students. More details during the lecture week before

## Homework Assignments (5%)
At least 2 out of 3 HWs assignments submitted on time is required.

 # Prerequisities

 The course is designed for students that have at least some basic coding experience. It does not need to be very advanced, but they should be aware of concepts such as ` for ` loop ,`if` and `else`,`variable` or `function`.

 No knowledge of Python is required for entering the course.

 # Credits
 Passing the course is rewarded with 5 ECTS credits.
